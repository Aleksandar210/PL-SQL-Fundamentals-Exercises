You have plenty of free time, so you decide to write a program that conceals and reveals your received messages in order to prevent Mark Zuckerberg from reading your messages with Patricia. Go ahead and type it in!

On the first table program_input you have the encrypted/concealed messages, and on the second table program_input_instructions you have the commands for a certain message with a key. There are several types of instructions, split by ":|:"

        "InsertSpace:|:{index}":

o   Inserts a single space at the given index. The given index will always be valid.

       "Reverse:|:{substring}":

o   If the message contains the given substring, cut it out, reverse it and add it at the end of the message.

o   If not, print "error".

o   This operation should replace only the first occurrence of the given substring if there are two or more occurrences.

Â·         "ChangeAll:|:{substring}:|:{replacement}"

o   Changes all occurrences of the given substring with the replacement text.

Note: Please check the set_things_up.sql  script to install the necessary tables and to see how the input should come!
